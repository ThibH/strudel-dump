# Strudel Experiments

This repository contains my experiments and explorations with [Strudel](https://strudel.cc), a live coding environment for algorithmic music composition.

## What is Strudel?

Strudel is a web-based live coding platform that allows you to create music using JavaScript patterns. It's inspired by TidalCycles and provides an accessible way to explore algorithmic composition and live performance.

## Repository Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ samples/          # Audio samples and sound files
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ songs/           # Completed compositions and experiments
â””â”€â”€ sketches/        # Work-in-progress ideas and quick tests
```

## Getting Started

1. Visit [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc) to access the online REPL
2. Load samples from the `samples/` directory
3. Use utility functions from `utils/` in your compositions
4. Check out `songs/` for examples and inspiration

## Contents

- **Samples**: Custom audio samples and found sounds
- **Utils**: Reusable functions for pattern generation, effects, and composition helpers  
- **Songs**: Finished pieces and structured compositions
- **Sketches**: Experimental code snippets and creative explorations

## Usage

Most code can be copy-pasted directly into the Strudel REPL. Some utilities may require minor adjustments depending on your setup.
